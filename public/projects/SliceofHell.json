      "content": "To create the pizza slicing mechanic, the pie is made up of 8 micro slices broken up into macro slices. When you make a cut, the system finds which macro slices are being touched by the cut, and then splits their children micro slices into the appropriate number of macro slices. If you cut a micro slice in half, all the slices to the left of the cut will go in one macro, and to the right in another. I then get the average angle of every micro slice contained, and move the macro slice a certain distance away from the center at that angle. "

Below you can see the The slicing in action, with a red line drawn from the center to the calculated position. The angle of the line is determined by the angle of each micro slice contained by the portion."
