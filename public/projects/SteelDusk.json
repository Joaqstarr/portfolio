      "content": "Steel Dusk required interaction between world elements, the player and multiple AI agents. To handle this, I utilized the event bus pattern to create a sense system. Anybody can send out sense triggers of particular types, which get sent out to every listener. To subscribe to a sense, you create an instance of a listener class that is designed to listen to the specific sense you would like. SenseListener is an abstract base class that has an abstract method that can be overriden to determine whether a sense can be heard. This can be a simple distance check, or something more complicated."
